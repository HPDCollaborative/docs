You can contribute to the documentation in the following two ways:

1. By cloning the repository and using GIT to submit a pull request.
2. By submitting your email address to be added to the official Dropbox for the docs.

In either scenario, please submit your email address and position to [Milla Marcano](mailto:mmarcano@hpd-collaborative.org) and specify whether you'd like to be added to the repository or Dropbox.

## Architecture {.doc-heading}

The documentation is built on a system called **[Doczilla](https://doczil.la)** which you can learn more about here: [https://doczil.la](https://doczil.la)

## Editing Files {.doc-heading}

Doczilla uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to simplify writing documents.

Markdown is the primary way text documents are written on the modern web and you can learn the syntax by following the link above.

There are many Markdown editor applications available for both download and online. The following article is a great place to start:
